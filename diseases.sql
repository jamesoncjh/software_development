Atovaquone targets the mitochondria of the parasite, while azithromycin inhibits its protein synthesis.\r\n\r\n2. Clindamycin and quinine: This combination is often used to treat severe or complicated cases of babesiosis. Quinine helps to kill the parasites, while clindamycin helps to prevent their replication.\r\n\r\nThe duration of treatment depends on the severity of the infection and the individual\'s response to the medication.

There are many different types of cancer, but all involve the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells.\r\n\r\nNormally, cells in the body grow, divide, and die in a controlled manner. Cancer occurs when mutations or changes in the DNA of a cell cause it to divide and grow uncontrollably.

(87, 'Pneumococcal Disease', 'Pneumococcal disease is an infection caused by the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. It can lead to a variety of illnesses, including pneumonia, meningitis, and blood infections. The bacteria can be spread through respiratory droplets, such as when a person with the infection coughs or sneezes, or by direct contact with contaminated surfaces.', '•	Fever\r\n•	Cough\r\n•	Shortness of breath\r\n•	Chest pain\r\n•	Headache\r\n•	Stiff neck\r\n•	Confusion\r\n•	Sensitivity to light\r\n', 'Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent pneumococcal disease. There are two types of pneumococcal vaccines: pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). Both vaccines can help protect against pneumococcal disease, but they are recommended for different age groups and populations.\r\n\r\nTreatment for pneumococcal disease typically involves antibiotics, but in severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary.\r\n\r\nPrevention of pneumococcal disease also involves practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly and covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. It is also important to avoid close contact with individuals who are sick with pneumococcal disease.\r\n'),
(88, 'Polio', 'Polio, also known as poliomyelitis, is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children. It is caused by the poliovirus, which is spread from person to person through contact with infected fecal matter or oral and nasal secretions.', 'Symptoms of polio can range from mild flu-like symptoms to more severe complications, including paralysis or even death.', 'There is currently no cure for polio, but it can be prevented through vaccination. The polio vaccine is safe, effective, and has been widely used since the 1950s to help control and eventually eliminate the disease.\r\n\r\nPolio eradication efforts have been successful, and the disease has been eliminated from most countries through vaccination campaigns. However, polio remains endemic in some countries, and efforts to vaccinate every child remain important to prevent the re-emergence of the disease.\r\n'),
(89, 'Prostate Cancer', 'Prostate cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the prostate gland, a small gland in the male reproductive system that produces seminal fluid. Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among men, and it usually develops in older men.', '•	Weak or interrupted urine flow\r\n•	Frequent urination\r\n•	Difficulty starting\r\n•	Stopping urination\r\n•	Pain or burning during urination\r\n•	Blood in the urine or semen\r\n•	Erectile dysfunction\r\n•	Pain in the lower back, hips, or thighs.\r\n', 'There are several tests used to screen for prostate cancer, including a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test and a digital rectal exam. If these tests indicate the possibility of prostate cancer, further tests, such as a prostate biopsy, may be recommended.\r\n\r\nTreatment for prostate cancer depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the patient\'s age and health, and the patient\'s personal preferences. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or a combination of these treatments.\r\n\r\nPrevention of prostate cancer may involve maintaining a healthy lifestyle, such as eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in red meat and fat, exercising regularly, and not smoking. Men should also discuss the benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening with their healthcare provider.\r\n'),
(90, 'Psittacosis', 'Psittacosis, also known as parrot fever, is a bacterial infection caused by Chlamydophila psittaci bacteria. The infection is most commonly associated with exposure to infected birds, particularly parrots, cockatiels, and budgerigars, but can also be contracted from other animals such as ducks, pigeons, and turkeys.', '•	Fever\r\n•	Chills\r\n•	Headache\r\n•	Muscle aches\r\n•	Cough\r\n•	Shortness of breath\r\n•	Chest pain\r\n', 'Psittacosis is typically diagnosed through blood tests or a culture of the bacteria from a respiratory sample. Treatment usually involves a course of antibiotics, such as doxycycline or azithromycin.\r\n\r\nPrevention of psittacosis involves avoiding contact with infected birds or handling them with proper precautions, such as wearing gloves and a mask, washing hands thoroughly after handling birds or their cages, and keeping living areas clean and well-ventilated. It is also important to avoid exposure to bird droppings, feathers, and other materials contaminated with the bacteria.\r\n');
