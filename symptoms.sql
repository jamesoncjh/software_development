Infections in the lungs, sinuses, or airways can also cause bad breath due to the presence of nasal secretions that may drain into the mouth. Chronic postnasal drip, for example as occurs with sinus infections, can be a cause of bad breath. \r\n\r\nCoughing up sputum from lung infections can also cause bad breath. Dry mouth (xerostomia) can be a side effect of certain medications, increasing the tendency to develop bad breath.

(14, 'Bleeding after vaginal sex', 'Bleeding after vaginal sex, also known as postcoital bleeding, is a common problem that can occur in women of all ages. It is often caused by minor trauma to the vaginal tissues during sex, such as rough penetration or lack of lubrication. In some cases, bleeding may also be caused by infections, such as yeast or bacterial vaginosis, or inflammation of the cervix or vagina. Cervical polyps, which are small growths on the cervix, may also cause bleeding after sex.
